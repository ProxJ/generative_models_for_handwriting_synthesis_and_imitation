# generative_models_for_handwriting_synthesis_and_imitation
Generative Advesarial Networks (GANs) have enabled computers to imitate style and generate data it has it has never seen before.  We investigate the ability of GANs to synthesize and imitate a person's handwriting style given just a few sample images of their handwriting. We extend the GAN-Writing model to imitate handwriting styles without the predefined writer styles which limits its imitation ability for new handwriting styles.  We show that GANs can imitate a person's handwriting and passes the Turing test. We also show that the combination of the triplet loss and cycle consistency make the GAN-Writing model to imitate handwriting styles in a few-short learning paradigm and also converges faster.
